üöÄ Tech Career & Certification Roadmaps
This project is a single-page, interactive roadmap tool built entirely with Vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and Tailwind CSS (via CDN). It provides structured, step-by-step learning paths for various tech careers and professional certifications, allowing users to track their progress through milestones.

‚ú® Features
Dual Roadmaps: Separate tabs for professional Career Paths (e.g., Software Engineer, AI Engineer) and Certification Paths (e.g., AWS Solutions Architect).

Interactive Progress Tracker: Users can mark individual learning milestones as complete, automatically updating a global progress bar for the selected roadmap.

Modular Learning: Each career path is broken down into thematic modules, with detailed sub-goals and external learning resources.

Client-Side State Management: The entire application state (active tab, selected roadmap, progress) is managed using a simple global JavaScript object, requiring no backend.

Search and Filter: Quickly find a roadmap using the integrated search bar.

üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack
HTML5: For core structure.

CSS (Tailwind CSS CDN): For utility-first styling and responsive design.

JavaScript (Vanilla JS): For all application logic, state management, and DOM manipulation (no external frameworks like React or Vue are used).
